## Progress for week 7

In this week:

ðŸ˜„ we created a Unity Project on Github and started work on our project scene. Also, to work in parallel we used multiple scenes and then merge elements on a main scene

ðŸ˜„ we started to work on our Eminescu Roundabout Digital Twin: we created the streets, the roundabout, the sidewalks, we added nature elements as the terrain, flowers, trees, grass and sky

:smile: we gray-box modeled our principal buildings: BCU, Palatul Copiilor, CCS and ISP

:smile: we introduced some assets for our treasure-hunt feature: at the moment a blue-flower

## Progress for week 9

In this week:

ðŸ˜„ we created a part of UI screens: *How to play*, *Settings*, *Progress* and *BCU* screens

:smile: we added more details on BCU building model

:smile: for the *Treasure hunt* functionality we created 2 scripts which manages the *collected* treasure: after the item is picked up it becomes inactive


## Progress for week 10

In this week:

:smile: Added sound effects and vibration when interacting with objects in scene.

:smile: Built app to VR and now we're testing in VR most changes.

:smile: Greatly improved BCU appearance.

:smile: Added Scriptable Objects on the UI elements, so now each building has the same UI template which updates dynamically based on a Scriptable Object

:smile: Reorganized project files into a Project Assets to differentiate imported assets vs our assets (As per teacher's request)

:smile: Added the UI elements in scene, almost done on the game flow

:smile: Added most treasure items, some placeholder in place for now, will replace later.

:smile: Changed the hands for the player to the Oculus Quest 3 Controllers
