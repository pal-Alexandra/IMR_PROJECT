## Progress for Lab 7

In this week:

:smile: we created a Unity Project on Github and started work on our project scene. Also, to work in parallel we used multiple scenes and then merge elements on a main scene

:smile: we started to work on our Eminescu Roundabout Digital Twin: we created the streets, the roundabout, the sidewalks, we added nature elements as the terrain, flowers, trees, grass and sky

:smile: we gray-box modeled our principal buildings: BCU, Palatul Copiilor, CCS and ISP

:smile: we introduced some assets for our treasure-hunt feature: at the moment a blue-flower

## Progress for Lab 9

In this week:

:smile: we created a part of UI screens: *How to play*, *Settings*, *Progress* and *BCU* screens

:smile: we added more details on BCU building model

:smile: for the *Treasure hunt* functionality we created 2 scripts which manages the *collected* treasure: after the item is picked up it becomes inactive


## Progress for Lab 10

In this week:

:smile: Added sound effects and vibration when interacting with objects in scene.

:smile: Built app to VR and now we're testing in VR most changes.

:smile: Greatly improved BCU appearance.

:smile: Added Scriptable Objects on the UI elements, so now each building has the same UI template which updates dynamically based on a Scriptable Object

:smile: Reorganized project files into a Project Assets to differentiate imported assets vs our assets (As per teacher's request)

:smile: Added the UI elements in scene, almost done on the game flow

:smile: Added most treasure items, some placeholder in place for now, will replace later. We used some models from Sketchfab for these, which we will modify.

:smile: Changed the hands for the player to the Oculus Quest 3 Controllers

:smile: Started texturing the BCU building

## Progress for Lab 11

In this week:

:smile: Added scriptable object for progress panel to be able to update it dynamically based on the treasure collected 

- When you find a treasure, the black and white image that is on the progress panel, it will then become colored

:smile: On the info panel, we added a base functionality that connects the Info Panel with the Treasure Hunt

- When you find a treasure, the info panel updates using a scriptable object based on the treasure collected. (If you find the Toy Bear -> The info panel updates with info for the Children's Palace building

:smile: Did some improvement on the BCU building texture and fixed a lot of issues with the texture rendering in VR (FIXED ENTIRE BUILDING so it renders properly in VR)

:smile: Attempted to use a 3D Scanning application to 3D scan the statues that would appear in the scene. Here are the results: (Images)

:smile: Added the necessary text for each building and also for the How to play panel. Basically finished the UI, only one left is the Settings panel.

:smile: Started working on the settings panel, basically we have to have separate terrains and skyboxes for each settings. Here's the current settings panel, and for each one we should have a terrain (for seasons) and skyboxes for the different combinations (Summer + Sunny) (Settings panel image)

:smile: Created AI made audio voices which will read the text on each panel when pressing a button for that. [sample audio recording](https://storage.googleapis.com/vocodes-public/media/9/d/f/t/b/9dftbzprq1z7r2hqcv7xggjdpkaydvya/fakeyou_9dftbzprq1z7r2hqcv7xggjdpkaydvya.wav)

:smile: Started adding NPCs which will roam around the scene using a simple AI
