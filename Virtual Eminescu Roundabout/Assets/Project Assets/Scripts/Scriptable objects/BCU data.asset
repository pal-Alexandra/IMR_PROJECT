  description: 'Founded in 1834, Central University Library ''Mihai Eminescu'' in
    Iasi, Romania, holds a distinguished place in the nation''s cultural and intellectual
    heritage. Initially established as part of Academia Mihaileana, it has evolved
    into one of Romania''s oldest and most esteemed cultural institutions. The library''s
    current neoclassical and art deco-inspired building, designed by Marcel Iancu
    and completed in 1934, is a testament to architectural finesse. Adorned with
    sculptures and intricate details, it serves as a welcoming gateway to a world
    of knowledge and culture. Its extensive collection, including rare manuscripts
    and an archive of Romanian literature, reflects a commitment to preserving and
    promoting the country''s cultural legacy. Throughout its history, the library
    has been a vibrant cultural hub, hosting events, lectures, and exhibitions. Its
    reading rooms have been witness to the exchange of ideas that have shaped the
    intellectual discourse of Iasi and beyond. '
